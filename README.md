# CS182 Final Project

Team Members: Chuqiao Yuan, Jay Li

This project investigates the problem of reinforcement learning for partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with multiple agents.

To study this problem, we used the open-source Pac-Man environment, as the basis environment to develop our algorithms and experiments. To model our reinforcement learning problem, we take the standpoint of the ghosts, the goal of which is to capture the pacman as fast as possible. To model the partial observation, we cut down the original full state information into a noisy relative position measurement between the ghosts and pacman.
