# CS182 Final Project

Team Members: Chuqiao Yuan, Jay Li

## Project Description
This is the final project repository for Harvard CS182 Artificial Intelligence course.

In this project, we investigate the problem of reinforcement learning for partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with multiple agents.

To study this problem, we used the open-source Pac-Man environment, as the basis environment to develop our algorithms and experiments. We take the standpoint of the ghosts, the goal of which is to capture the pacman as fast as possible. With various settings, the problem can be cast into a MDP problem, RL problem, POMDP and RL with partial observation. The algorithms are implemented accordingly.
